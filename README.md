MATCHSTICK
===

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.

There is a certain number of matchstick lines.

The two players (here one is the ai) take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.

The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

The goal here is to make the ai remove the last match. Good Luck!

To launch the game:

```
$ make 
$ ./Matchstick [line_amount] [Match_remove_limit]
```
